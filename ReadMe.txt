Fifteens 

a word game developed by Richard Sapp

HISTORY:
Fifteens is based on an ancient drinking game from the times when people would
gather together to imbibe spirituous drinks. The game begins when someone
in the circle says "1", then the next person says "2," and that continues
until the number "15" is said, at which point, everyone would take a drink.
then the person who said "15" chooses a number and a word and says "'2' is
now 'dog.'" Then the next person in line to speak would start over at "1,"
but the person after would say "dog" instead of "2." If the person says "2"
instead of "dog" they take a drink, and the counting starts over. This is 
the history and the basic gameplay of "Fifteens."

RULES:
In this version of the game, a single player tries to go for the highest 
number of points. A point is granted each time the player successfully makes 
it to fifteen. To make it more interesting, there is a "help" button which 
very briefly flashes the word onscreen if a player forgets the word, but the
player loses a point every time they click "help." It is much easier to lose
points than it is to gain them.

A congratulations message appears if you make it to 15 points

You must count 1-15 to start choosing words. This is your one free point!

If you cant think of a word, just click random! I swear those are real words!

Have fun testing your memory and vocabulary!
